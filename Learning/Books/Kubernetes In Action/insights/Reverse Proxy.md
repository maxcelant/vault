### Why is it called that?
It's called a reverse proxy because, unlike a traditional (forward) proxy that sits between a client and the internet, a reverse proxy sits between the internet and servers. It "reverses" the typical direction of proxying by handling requests from the internet to a server, rather than from a client to the internet.

### What does it do?
A reverse proxy sits between client devices and backend servers. It receives requests from client devices (such as users' computers or smartphones), forwards these requests to the appropriate backend servers, and then returns the responses from the servers back to the clients.
