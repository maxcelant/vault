- "_Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction_"
	- It's okay to stick to your current refactoring path finishing it before going on a tangent and abstracting before you get the full picture.
- "_Refactor under green_"
	- Use tests as a safety net for refactoring. Once you have green, THEN abstract/refactor.
