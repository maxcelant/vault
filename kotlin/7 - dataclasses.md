Data classes are a concise way to create classes that primarily hold data. They automatically provide `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, `copy()`, and `componentN()` functions:

```kotlin
data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)

val user1 = User("Alice", 30)
val user2 = user1.copy(name = "Bob")
println(user1)  // Output: User(name=Alice, age=30)
println(user2)  // Output: User(name=Bob, age=30)
```

These features of Kotlin make it a powerful language for OOP, providing a clean and concise way to implement common OOP concepts. Each of these concepts plays a crucial role in Kotlin and OOP in general, and mastering them is key to writing effective Kotlin code.
