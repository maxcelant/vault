Great! Let's dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Kotlin, focusing on classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, interfaces, and data classes. 

### Classes and Objects

#### Basic Class
In Kotlin, a class is defined using the `class` keyword. Here's a simple example:

```kotlin
class Car {
    fun drive() {
        println("Driving...")
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the class
val myCar = Car()
myCar.drive()  // Output: Driving...
```

#### Constructor
Kotlin has a concise syntax for constructors:

```kotlin
class Car(val make: String, val model: String) {
    fun displayInfo() {
        println("Car: $make $model")
    }
}

val car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
car.displayInfo()  // Output: Car: Toyota Corolla
```

### Inheritance

#### Base and Derived Classes
Kotlin classes are `final` by default; use `open` to allow inheritance:

```kotlin
open class Vehicle(val name: String)

class Car(name: String, val model: String) : Vehicle(name)
```

#### Overriding Methods
To override a method, it must be marked as `open` in the base class and `override` in the derived class:

```kotlin
open class Vehicle {
    open fun drive() {
        println("Driving a vehicle...")
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle() {
    override fun drive() {
        println("Driving a car...")
    }
}
```

### Abstraction

#### Abstract Classes
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and are often used as base classes:

```kotlin
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract fun drive()
}

class Car : Vehicle() {
    override fun drive() {
        println("Driving a car...")
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism

Kotlin supports polymorphism, which allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class:

```kotlin
open class Vehicle {
    open fun drive() {
        println("Driving a vehicle...")
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle() {
    override fun drive() {
        println("Driving a car...")
    }
}

val myVehicle: Vehicle = Car()
myVehicle.drive()  // Output: Driving a car...
```
