The caching mechanism in GitHub Actions is designed to speed up workflows by reusing data from previous runs of the same workflow. In the context of Python dependencies, it allows you to save the installed packages so that you don't have to download and install them from scratch in every run.

```yaml
- name: Cache pipenv dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ~/.local/share/virtualenvs
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pipenv-${{ hashFiles('**/Pipfile.lock') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pipenv-
```

- The `path` is where `pipenv` typically installs its virtual environments. 
- The `key` is a unique identifier for this cache. Here, it's based on the OS and a hash of the `Pipfile.lock`, ensuring the cache only matches if the lock file hasn't changed. 
- `restore-keys` provides a fallback prefix if an exact key match isn't found, allowing older caches to be used as a starting point.
