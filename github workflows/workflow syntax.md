#### Workflow Files
Defined in `.github/workflows`

Check out the **[[anatomy of a workflow]]** to see how a workflow is structured.

Workflows should contain the following:
- **[[naming]]** - To make your workflow have a specific identifier.
- **[['on' keyword]]** - To decide the trigger for the workflow event.
- **[[GitHub Workflows/jobs]]** - To perform a specific requirement.
- **[['uses' keyword]]** - That points to an existing action.
- **[['run' keyword]]** - That is used to execute a command directly.
