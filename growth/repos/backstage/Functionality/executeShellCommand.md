```ts
export async function executeShellCommand(
  options: ExecuteShellCommandOptions,

  const {
    command,
    args,
    options: spawnOptions,
    logStream = new PassThrough(),
  } = options;

  await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    const process = spawn(command, args, spawnOptions);

    process.stdout.on('data', stream => {
      logStream.write(stream);
    });

    process.stderr.on('data', stream => {
      logStream.write(stream);
    });

    process.on('error', error => {
      return reject(error);
    });

    process.on('close', code => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        return reject(
          new Error(`Command ${command} failed, exit code: ${code}`),

Let's go through the `executeShellCommand` function step by step in simple terms:

1. **Function Definition**: This is an `async` function named `executeShellCommand`. Being `async` means it can be used with `await` for asynchronous operations. It takes an argument `options`, which is an object that conforms to the `ExecuteShellCommandOptions` type. This object contains all the settings and options needed to run the shell command.

2. **Extracting Options**: Within the function, the first thing that happens is destructuring of the `options` object. This means breaking down the structure into individual variables that are easier to use in the code:

   - `command`: The executable command to run (like `python` or `bash`).
   - `args`: An array of arguments to pass to the command.
   - `spawnOptions`: Additional options that can be passed to the child process, like the working directory or environment variables.
   - `logStream`: A stream to capture the output from the command. If none is provided, it creates a new `PassThrough` stream. This stream will collect all the output from the command for logging or debugging purposes.

3. **Running the Command**: It uses Node.js's `spawn` function from the `child_process` module to start a new process to run the `command` with the given `args`. This is an asynchronous operation, so it's wrapped in a `new Promise` to manage the asynchronous flow.

4. **Handling Output**: It attaches two listeners to the spawned process:

   - One for `stdout` (standard output), which captures anything the process writes to its standard output (like console logs).
   - One for `stderr` (standard error), which captures any error messages that the process writes to its error stream.

   Both of these listeners write to the `logStream`, which means they collect all output from the command, be it regular messages or errors.

5. **Handling Errors**: It attaches an error handler for the spawned process. If there's an error in spawning or running the process (like the command not being found), it will reject the promise with that error, effectively throwing an error in an asynchronous way.

6. **Handling Completion**: It attaches a listener for the `close` event, which is emitted when the process has finished running. The `close` event provides a `code`, which is the exit code of the process:

   - If the `code` is not `0`, the process ended with an error, so the promise is rejected with an error message including the command and the exit code. In the UNIX world, an exit code of `0` typically means "success," and any non-zero value indicates an error.
   - If the `code` is `0`, the process ended successfully, and the promise is resolved, indicating that the asynchronous operation is complete without any errors.

7. **Awaiting Completion**: The function returns a promise due to the `async` keyword and the `await` used before the `new Promise` call. This means that when you call `executeShellCommand`, you can await it, and it will wait until the child process has finished executing before moving on to the next line of code.

This function allows you to execute a shell command within a Node.js application and handle its output and errors properly, all within an asynchronous context. It provides a structured way to deal with command execution, capturing output, and error handling.
