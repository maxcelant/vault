Understanding that Python threads map 1:1 with OS threads is crucial for performance and design decisions. While it might suggest potential for true parallel execution, the presence of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython hampers this for CPU-bound tasks. Moreover, each OS thread introduces memory and system overhead. Being aware of this relationship aids in predicting program behavior, effectively debugging concurrency issues, and making informed choices on the right concurrency tools or methods to use, especially when integrating with native libraries or tuning for specific platforms.
