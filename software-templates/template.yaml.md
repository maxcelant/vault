The `template.yaml` file you've shown is a Backstage Software Template configuration. Software Templates in Backstage allow you to standardize and automate the creation of components, and this YAML file describes a blueprint for new components. This specific template is configured to scaffold a new Create React App project and register it to Backstage and GitHub.

The YAML file is used to create a form which the user fills out with whatever fields are given in the YAML file. 

```yaml
parameters:
  - title: Provide some simple information
    required:
      - component_id
      - owner
    properties:
      component_id:
        title: Name
        type: string
        description: Unique name of the component
        ui:field: EntityNamePicker
      description:
        title: Description
        type: string
        description: Help others understand what this website is for.
      owner:
        title: Owner
        type: string
        description: Owner of the component
        ui:field: OwnerPicker
        ui:options:
          allowedKinds:
            - Group
```

`component_id`, `description`, and `owner` represent different HTML fields in a form. 

`type` is the data-type of the HTML input field.

Backstage is responsible for reading this `parameters` config and rendering it as a form in the UI. 

Note that, in this YAML file, there are also some custom UI fields (like `EntityNamePicker` and `OwnerPicker`) which are specific to Backstage and provide custom functionality for picking entity names or owners.
