- **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend upon details; details should depend upon abstractions.
- **Practical Application:** In a logging system, instead of having the application's high-level modules directly depend on a specific logger (a low-level module), use an abstract `Logger` interface. Different logger implementations can be created that implement the `Logger` interface. The high-level modules interact with the `Logger` interface, allowing for easy substitution and extension of logger behavior.
