Each lesson would include a lecture component, recommended readings (such as the textbooks previously mentioned), practical exercises, and discussion prompts. The course would also feature guest lectures by industry experts, project work, and a comprehensive final exam or project to apply the concepts learned throughout the course.

To ensure that the content remains up-to-date and relevant, it would be important to incorporate the latest research, case studies, and best practices from the field of software architecture. Additionally, practical experience with actual software design and architecture would be a significant part of the learning process.
