Monads don't exactly determine the "state" of a variable or what it might be, but rather, they provide a framework for handling computations on variables in a certain context or with certain properties, like state or uncertainty. Let's clarify this a bit:

### Monad's Role
1. **Context Handling:**
    - Monads handle the context around a value, not just the value itself. This context can be related to state, uncertainty (like in the `Maybe` monad), side effects, or asynchronous computations, among others.
2. **Chaining Computations:**
    - They allow for chaining operations on these values within their context. This chaining respects the rules of the monad, which could involve handling nulls, managing state, or dealing with side effects.
3. **Uniform Interface:**
    - Monads provide a uniform interface (like `bind` and `return` operations) to interact with different types of contexts. This makes it easier to write generic code that works with any monad.

### What Monads Are Not
1. **Not Just for State Determination:**
    - While some monads, like the `State` monad, deal with stateful computations, not all monads are about state. For instance, the `Maybe` monad is about handling the presence or absence of a value.
2. **Not About Variable Types:**
    - Monads arenâ€™t about determining what a variable might be in terms of its data type. Instead, they are about providing a context for how computations are handled on that type.

### Examples

- **Maybe Monad:** Handles computations with values that might or might not be present. It's not about the "state" of a variable but rather about handling the uncertainty of presence.
    
- **List Monad:** Handles computations over lists of values, allowing for operations to be applied to each element in the list, and handling the list as a whole.
    
- **IO Monad:** Handles computations with side effects, like input/output operations, ensuring that these effects are managed in a controlled way.
    

### Summary

- Think of monads as a pattern or a framework that provides a consistent way to work with computations that need to be handled in a certain context (like with uncertainty, state, or side effects).
- They are a foundational concept in functional programming, offering a way to write code that is both safe and composable, even when dealing with complex scenarios.
