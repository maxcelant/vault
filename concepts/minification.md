Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from source code without changing its functionality. These unnecessary characters can include white space, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block delimiters, which are useful for human readability but serve no purpose in execution.

The reason for minifying code is to reduce its size, which in turn decreases the load times of web pages. Smaller file sizes mean faster downloads and less bandwidth consumption, which can improve the performance of web applications significantly, especially on mobile devices with slower internet connections.

For instance, a JavaScript file straight out of development might be quite readable with plenty of white space and comments, but it could be several hundred kilobytes in size. After minification, the file could be reduced to a fraction of that size, making it much quicker for a browser to download and execute.

Tools like UglifyJS or Terser are commonly used for minifying JavaScript files, and they are often integrated into build processes to automate the minification as part of the deployment pipeline.
