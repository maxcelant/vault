#### Controller
A **controller** acts as the intermediary between the client (such as a web browser) and the application's core business logic. It processes incoming requests, invokes the necessary services or business logic, and returns responses. In an Express.js application, controllers handle route management, parsing of requests, and sending of responses.

#### Service
A **service**, on the other hand, is focused on the application's business logic. It encapsulates the core operations, rules, and algorithms that define the functionality of the application. Services are used by controllers or other services and are designed to be reusable and modular.

#### Building Intuition
- **Controllers** are like the waiters in a restaurant: they take your order (request), pass it to the kitchen (service), and bring back your food (response).
- **Services** are like the kitchen staff: they prepare your order based on the recipes and ingredients available (business logic).

#### Example with Express.js

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const userService = require('./userService'); // This is an example service module

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Controller for handling a GET request to "/users"
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const users = await userService.getAllUsers(); // Calling the service
        res.json(users);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send(error.message);
    }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this example:
- The controller is set up within the Express route handler (`app.get('/users', ...)`) which listens for requests and sends responses.
- The service (`userService.getAllUsers()`) encapsulates the logic to fetch all users, abstracting the details from the controller.
