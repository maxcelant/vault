In Rust, `mut` stands for "mutable". It indicates that something can be changed.

1. **Variables**: When you declare a variable as `mut`, it means you can change its value.

   ```rust
   let mut x = 5;
   x = 6; // This is allowed because x is mutable
   ```

   Without `mut`, the variable is immutable (cannot be changed):

   ```rust
   let y = 5;
   // y = 6; // This would be an error because y is immutable
   ```

2. **References**: When you have a `&mut` reference, it means you can change the value the reference points to.

   ```rust
   let mut z = 10;
   let a = &mut z;
   *a = 20; // Changing the value of z through the mutable reference a
   ```

In simple terms: 
- **Without `mut`**: Think of it as a "read-only" version. You can look, but you can't change.
- **With `mut`**: Think of it as a "read-write" version. You can look and you can change.

Rust's emphasis on specifying mutability is part of its commitment to safety. By making you explicitly choose when something can be changed, it minimizes unintended side-effects and data races in concurrent situations.
