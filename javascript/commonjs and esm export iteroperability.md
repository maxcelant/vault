In JavaScript, CommonJS and ECMAScript Modules (ESM) handle module exports differently, leading to interoperability challenges:

- **CommonJS Modules:** Designed for server-side JavaScript, allowing modules to export a single object, which can be a function, class, or an object literal. This object represents the module's public API.

  ```javascript
  // CommonJS export pattern
  module.exports = {
      myFunction: function() { /* ... */ }
  };
  ```

- **ESM:** A standard for JavaScript modules in the browser, supporting both named and default exports directly in the module syntax.

  ```javascript
  // ESM export patterns
  export default function myDefaultFunction() { /* ... */ }
  export const myNamedExport = /* ... */;
  ```

**Interoperability Issues:**

- **Default and Named Exports:** CommonJS does not natively support the concept of "default" and "named" exports as ESM does. This difference can cause issues when importing CommonJS modules in an ESM context, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
  
- **Transpilation and Tooling:** Tools like Rollup attempt to bridge these differences by transpiling CommonJS modules for ESM compatibility. However, this process can introduce its own set of challenges, especially when a module includes a mix of default and named exports.
  
- **Node.js's Solution:** Node.js provides an interoperability layer to import CommonJS modules into ESM, treating the `module.exports` object as the default export and attempting to recognize any named exports. This can lead to `default.default` wrapping issues when accessing the default export from ESM.

**Recommendation:** Transition away from CommonJS for projects that need seamless interoperability with ESM, especially when working with modern JavaScript environments or tools like TypeScript, which favor ESM syntax.
