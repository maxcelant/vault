The `bind` method in JavaScript is used to create a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to a provided value. In the code snippet `export const mocked = JestMock.mocked.bind(JestMock);`, the `bind` method is being used to create a new version of the `mocked` function with its `this` context permanently set to the `JestMock` object.

### Understanding `bind` with Your Example

- **Original Function:** `JestMock.mocked` is presumably a method on the `JestMock` object.
- **Binding `this`:** By calling `bind(JestMock)` on this method, you create a new function where `this` inside the `mocked` method always refers to `JestMock`.
- **Why Use `bind`:** This is particularly useful when you want to pass around a method as a standalone function but still want it to retain a reference to its original object.

### Example of How `bind` Works

Here, `myObject` is an object with a property `value` and a method `getValue`. The `getValue` method uses `this` to refer to the object it belongs to (in this case, `myObject`). When `getValue` is called as `myObject.getValue()`, `this` inside `getValue` refers to `myObject`, and thus `this.value` is `42`.

```javascript
const myObject = {
  value: 42,
  getValue: function() {
    return this.value;
  }
};
```

In this line, you're extracting the `getValue` method from `myObject` and assigning it to a new variable `getValue`. When you call `getValue()` now, it's being called as a standalone function, not as a method of `myObject`. In the context of a standalone function call, `this` does not refer to `myObject` anymore. In strict mode, `this` will be `undefined`, leading to `undefined` being returned (or an error if you try to access `undefined.value`). In non-strict mode, `this` might refer to the global object, which does not have a `value` property set, leading to `undefined`.

```js
const getValue = myObject.getValue;
console.log(getValue());
```

Here, you're using the `bind` method to create a new function (`boundGetValue`) that is permanently bound to `myObject`. The `bind` method takes an object and returns a new function where `this` is set to the provided object. So, when you call `boundGetValue()`, it calls the original `getValue` function with `this` set to `myObject`, resulting in the correct value (`42`) being returned.

```js
const boundGetValue = myObject.getValue.bind(myObject);
console.log(boundGetValue()); // 42, 'this' is bound to myObject
```
