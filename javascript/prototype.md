In JavaScript, a prototype is a mechanism for defining shared properties and methods across instances of a particular object or class. 

When you create multiple objects from a single class, they all share the same prototype, which holds the methods and properties that are common to all instances of that class. 

This helps save memory, as the methods and properties are stored in one place (the prototype) rather than being duplicated across every instance.
