Used to _centralize_ service catalog and software templates. Allows teams to manage their services, APIs, and technology infrastructure. 

#### Plugin Architecture
Your version of Backstage could have the plugins it needs, and they can be added or removed as you wish.

#### Service Catalog
A companies software components like an online site, mobile app, internal tools and so on - would be represented in the backstage catalog. It would show things like: ownership, health/status, documentation, and dependencies. 

#### Developer Portal
A one-stop-shop for devs to manage their services, work with APIs, access docs and use the dev tools they need. Integrates with tools and services like CI/CD systems to monitoring and observability tools. Allows them quick access to documentation. Also allows visibility into what other teams are working on.
