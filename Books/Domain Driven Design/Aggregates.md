An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An important aspect of an aggregate is that it has a boundary around it, which is enforced by a root entity, known as the Aggregate Root.

An aggregate can include one or more entities, zero or more value objects, or a combination of both. It's not a requirement to have both entities and value objects together in an aggregate.

**Aggregate Roots**
The Aggregate Root is the main entity within the aggregate. It's the gatekeeper through which all interactions with the aggregate must occur. It ensures the integrity of the aggregate by controlling access to its components and maintaining consistency.
