- `Jobs` are used to create processes that terminate at some point.
- The job will automatically create a new pod with the process if one unexpectedly exits.
- You can run multiple pod instances in a job.
	- You can even choose whether to run them sequentially or in parallel.
- Using `activeDeadlineSeconds` you can have a pod terminate after the given time.
- `CronJobs` also fall under this category, though they are their own resource.
