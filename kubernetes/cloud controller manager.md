The cloud-controller-manager handles the interactions that are specific to your particular cloud provider. This includes node controller for checking the cloud provider to see if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding, route controller for setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure, and service controller for creating, updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers.
