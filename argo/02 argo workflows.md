During development, there will be tasks that rely on previous tasks to be completed, creating a sort-of chain or directed acyclic graph (DAG) of responsibilities. That's what Argo Workflows focuses on. It can handle and maintain each chain/node in the link in the process. Each node is basically a complex task or job that needs to be completed for the process to move forward. Argo helps maintain and automate the process.


#### Example
1. **Data Gathering:** The application requires weather data to function. This task involves gathering historical weather data and current weather data.
    
2. **Data Cleaning:** The gathered data might have inconsistencies or missing values that need to be addressed. This task depends on the completion of the Data Gathering task.
    
3. **Feature Engineering:** This step involves transforming raw data into features more understandable to machine learning models. It can only start after the Data Cleaning task is done.
    
4. **Model Training:** Here, we use our prepared data to train our machine learning model. This task depends on the Feature Engineering task.
    
5. **Model Evaluation:** Once our model is trained, we need to evaluate its performance. It can't start until Model Training is done.
    
6. **Model Deployment:** If the model performs well, we deploy it to the production environment. This task depends on the Model Evaluation.
    
7. **App Development:** Meanwhile, a team is working on developing the new features of the app that will use this model. This task doesn't depend on others and can be done in parallel.
    
8. **App Testing:** This involves testing the newly developed features of the app. It can only start when the App Development is complete.
    
9. **Integration:** Here, we integrate the deployed model with the developed app features. This task depends on both Model Deployment and App Testing.
    
10. **Deployment:** Finally, we deploy our application with the new feature to the production environment. This task depends on the Integration task.
