Alright, imagine you have a toy car. This car needs batteries to run. Instead of permanently attaching a specific battery inside the car, there's a battery slot where you can easily put in any type of battery that fits.

Whenever you want the car to run faster, you put in a stronger battery. When you just want it to move slowly, you put in a regular battery. You can change the behavior of the car by simply changing the battery you "inject" into it.

In this analogy:
- The toy car is like a piece of software or an application.
- The battery slot is a space where you can put different things to change how the car (or software) behaves.
- The act of putting in different batteries is like "dependency injection." You're providing (or "injecting") the car with what it needs (its "dependency" - the battery) to run.

In software, "dependency injection" means giving a part of the program the tools or information it needs to work, instead of having them hardcoded or permanently set inside. This makes software more flexible and easier to change or test. Just like swapping out batteries in the toy car!

#### Example
```python
class EmailService:
    def send_message(self, message, recipient):
        # code to send email
        print(f"Email sent to {recipient}: {message}")

class SMSService:
    def send_message(self, message, recipient):
        # code to send SMS
        print(f"SMS sent to {recipient}: {message}")

class Notification:
    def __init__(self, service):
        self.service = service
    
    def notify(self, message, recipient):
        self.service.send_message(message, recipient)

# Using EmailService
email_notifier = Notification(EmailService())
email_notifier.notify("Hello!", "user@example.com")

# Using SMSService
sms_notifier = Notification(SMSService())
sms_notifier.notify("Hello!", "123-456-7890")
```

- We've added an `SMSService` to show another type of messaging service.
- The `Notification` class now accepts any service (like `EmailService` or `SMSService`) as a parameter. This is the core of dependency injection: you "inject" the dependency (in this case, the service) into the class.
- This design is more flexible. If you create new services (e.g., `PushNotificationService`), you can easily use them without changing the `Notification` class.
