To "transpile" code means to convert source code written in one language into the equivalent code in another language. When developers refer to transpilation in the context of web development, they're often talking about converting modern JavaScript (ES6/ES2015 and later versions) into a version of JavaScript that is compatible with older browsers (like ES5).

For example, if a developer is using the latest JavaScript features that are not supported in older browsers, they may use a tool like Babel to transpile their modern JavaScript code into a form that is compatible with older browsers. This ensures that the web application can run on a wider range of user devices without requiring those users to update their browsers.
