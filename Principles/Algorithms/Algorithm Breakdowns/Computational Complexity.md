#### P (_Polynomial Time_)
- A problem that can be solved quickly, be not necessarily confirmed quickly.

#### NP (_Nondeterministic Polynomial Time_)
- A problem that is easy to confirm to be true but difficult to solve.
- An example is the graph clique problem, which checks to see if a number of nodes are interconnected. It's difficult to solve but easy to confirm by looking at it.

#### NP-Complete
- This problem is really hard, and it's a representative champion of hard problems in NP. If you can conquer this one quickly, you can conquer them all.

#### NP-hard
- Not necessarily in NP. Meaning it may not be easily confirmed or solvable.
- At least as hard as the hardest problems in NP, maybe even harder.
