The slide you've provided is explaining the concept of a min-cut problem in the context of graph theory. In a network (which can be represented as a graph with nodes and edges), a cut is a way of splitting the nodes into two disjoint subsets such that one subset contains the source node (often denoted as s) and the other contains the sink node (denoted as t).

1. **st-cut (cut)**: This is a division or partition of the nodes in a graph into two groups, A and B. The source node s is in group A, and the sink node t is in group B.
2. **Capacity of a cut**: For any cut, the capacity is the sum of the capacities of the edges that go from nodes in set �A to nodes in set �B. The capacity of an edge is a measure of the "flow" it can carry, represented as a number (often thought of as bandwidth or volume).

The slide uses the following notation for capacity: cap(A,B)=∑e out of A(c). This means that the capacity of a cut cap(A,B) is the sum of the capacities c(e) of all edges e that start in A and end in B.
