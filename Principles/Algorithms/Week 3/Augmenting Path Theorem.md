The Augmenting Path Theorem is a fundamental result in the field of network flows, which is part of graph theory. It's closely associated with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.

Here's the theorem stated more formally:

"A flow \( f \) in a network is a maximum flow if and only if there are no augmenting paths relative to \( f \)."

An "augmenting path" is defined as a path from the source \( s \) to the sink \( t \) in the residual graph where the residual capacity (which is the original capacity of an edge minus the flow that's already using that edge) is greater than zero for every edge in the path. In other words, it's a path along which you can still send some positive amount of flow.

This theorem essentially has two parts:

1. **If there are no augmenting paths relative to \( f \), then \( f \) must be a maximum flow.**
   This is because if there were any way to send more flow from \( s \) to \( t \), there would be an augmenting path through which you could increase the flow. The absence of such a path means you cannot increase the flow any further, hence \( f \) is maximal.

2. **If \( f \) is a maximum flow, then there are no augmenting paths relative to \( f \).**
   If \( f \) is a maximum flow, you can't increase the flow value. If there were an augmenting path, then you could send more flow along that path, which would increase the flow value, contradicting the assumption that \( f \) is a maximum flow.

The implication of the Augmenting Path Theorem is that you can find the maximum flow by repeatedly finding augmenting paths and increasing the flow until no more augmenting paths exist. This is what the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm does: it starts with a flow of 0 and repeatedly finds augmenting paths, adjusting the flow until no further adjustments can be made. When it stops, according to the theorem, the current flow must be a maximum flow.
