- Collator is like an organizer. Like if you had a box of random colored legos, the collator could put them in special piles for you.
- It takes raw data, processes it and organizes it into a specific format so the search engine can easily find accurate info.
- They are readable object streams of documents that conform to a minimum set of fields (like title, location, text), but can contain any other fields defined by the collator.

- If you want to see an example, look at [[catalogcollatorfactory|this]].
