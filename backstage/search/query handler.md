- Takes that translated question and knows how to find the answers in the search engineâ€™s data.

#### Example

1. **Receive Query:** 
   - It receives the search query that you've typed in. If there's a Query Translator in place, the query would come translated into a format the search engine understands.

2. **Parse Query:** 
   - The Query Handler parses the query to understand what you are looking for. It breaks down the query into parts, like keywords, phrases, or other criteria.

3. **Generate Search Plan:** 
   - It then creates a plan on how to search the data. This may include deciding which indices to search in, what order to search them, and how to combine the results.

4. **Execute Search:**
   - Now, it executes the search based on the plan. It looks through the search engine's indexed data to find the relevant information matching your query.

5. **Collect Results:** 
   - As it finds matching items, it collects them together. It might also sort or rank the results based on relevance to your query or other criteria.

6. **Return Results:** 
   - Finally, it returns the collected results back to you as the search results you see on your screen.

Throughout this process, the Query Handler interacts with the search engine's index and other components to ensure that the search is performed efficiently and accurately, providing you with the relevant results for your query.
