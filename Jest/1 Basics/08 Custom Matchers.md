If none of the available matchers suit your needs, you can create your own:

```javascript
expect.extend({
  toBeWithinRange(received, floor, ceiling) {
    const pass = received >= floor && received <= ceiling;
    if (pass) {
      return {
        message: () => `expected ${received} not to be within range ${floor} - ${ceiling}`,
        pass: true,
      };
    } else {
      return {
        message: () => `expected ${received} to be within range ${floor} - ${ceiling}`,
        pass: false,
      };
    }
  },
});

test('num is within range', () => {
  expect(10).toBeWithinRange(1, 20);
});
```
