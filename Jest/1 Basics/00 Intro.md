- **Zero configuration required**: Jest aims to work out of the box, requiring little to no configuration in most projects.
    
- **Excellent mocking support**: Jest has extensive built-in support for creating and managing mock objects, and provides powerful tools for mocking (or "spying on") functions.
    
- **Fast and sandboxed**: Jest runs tests in parallel processes, which makes it very fast. Each test file is run in its own environment, which prevents different tests from colliding with each other.
    
- **Code coverage**: Jest has built-in support for tracking code coverage, using Istanbul under the hood. Code coverage helps developers understand how much of their code is being tested, which can be important in large projects.
    
- **Snapshot testing**: Jest introduced the concept of "snapshot testing" to the JavaScript world, making it easier to capture and compare snapshots of your components or data over time.
