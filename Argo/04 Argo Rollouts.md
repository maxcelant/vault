Argo provides these tools which make development much safer by creating new versions or by gradually changing the current software and checking for problems.

**Blue/Green Deployment**
You have newer software (green) with the changes you want from the original (blue), and only change them out when green works as intended.

**Canary Deployment**
Make a change, make sure everything still works. Keep doing this until you have made all the changes you want.
