1. **Split Panes**
    - **Horizontal Split** (splits the pane into top and bottom sections): Press `Cmd` + `D`.
    - **Vertical Split** (splits the pane into left and right sections): Press `Cmd` + `Shift` + `D`.
2. **Navigate Between Panes**
    - To move between split panes, you can press `Cmd` + `Option` + `Arrow Key` (the direction you want to move).
3. **Unsplit (Close) Panes**
    - To close the current pane, you simply need to exit the session in that pane, usually by typing `exit` or pressing `Cmd` + `W`. When you do this, the pane will close, and the remaining pane(s) will adjust to use the available space.
4. **Resize Panes**
    - To resize panes, place your mouse over the divider line between them. When the cursor changes to a resize cursor, click and drag to adjust the pane size.
