#### Concept:
In Rust, scalar values like integers (`i32`, `u32`, etc.), floating-point numbers (`f32`, `f64`), and other basic types (`char`, `bool`) implement the `Copy` trait. This trait has a significant implication on how these types behave when passed to functions.

#### Behavior:
- **Automatic Copying**: When a scalar value that implements the `Copy` trait is passed to a function, Rust automatically creates a copy of that value for the function's scope.
- **Independence of Values**: The original value in the calling function remains unchanged and valid, regardless of any modifications made to the copied value in the called function.

#### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    add_five(num);
    println!("Original num in main: {}", num); // Prints 10
}

fn add_five(mut x: i32) {
    x += 5;
    // x is now 15, but this does not affect 'num' in 'main'
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **No Ownership Transfer**: Unlike types that don't implement `Copy`, passing a `Copy` type to a function does not transfer ownership. Both the original and the function's copy can coexist independently.
- **Mutability Irrelevant for Copy**: Whether the variable is mutable or immutable is irrelevant to the copying behavior. The copy is independent of its source.
- **Efficient for Small Types**: This mechanism is efficient for small, simple types and is a cornerstone of Rust's memory safety and efficiency.

#### Applicability:
Understanding the `Copy` trait's role is crucial in Rust, especially when dealing with scalar values and designing functions that interact with such types.
