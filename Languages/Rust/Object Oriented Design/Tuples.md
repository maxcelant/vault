Creating tuples:

```rust
fn main() {
    let cat = ("Furry McFurson", 3.5);
    let (name, age) = cat;

    println!("{} is {} years old.", name, age);
}
```

Indexing with tuples:

```rust
fn indexing_tuple() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3);
    // Replace below ??? with the tuple indexing syntax.
    let second = numbers.1;

    assert_eq!(2, second,
        "This is not the 2nd number in the tuple!")
}
```
