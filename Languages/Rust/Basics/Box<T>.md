- **Purpose**: `Box<T>` is a smart pointer in Rust used for heap allocation. It points to data allocated on the heap, rather than the stack.
- **Heap Allocation**: The stack is limited in size and used for static memory allocation, but the heap allows for dynamic memory allocation, which can accommodate larger data or data whose size is not known at compile time.
- **Ownership**: `Box<T>` owns the data it points to. When the `Box` goes out of scope, the data it points to is dropped (deallocated).
- **Usage**: Useful when you have large data structures to prevent stack overflow, or when you want to ensure a consistent size for a type (e.g., in recursive types).
- **Syntax**: Create a `Box` by calling `Box::new(value)`. For example, `let b = Box::new(5);` creates a box that points to the value `5` on the heap.
- **Dereferencing**: Use `*` to dereference a `Box` to access the value it points to. For example, `*b` in the above example would give `5`.
- **Memory Management**: Rust automatically deallocates heap memory when the `Box` goes out of scope, making it a zero-cost abstraction in terms of memory management.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Recursive types: e.g., linked lists, trees.
  - Large data structures: To avoid stack overflow.
  - Ownership transfers: When you want to transfer ownership without copying the data.
- **Performance**: While `Box<T>` adds a level of indirection (since you're accessing data on the heap), it's a powerful tool for managing memory safely and efficiently in Rust.

#### Example Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(10);
    println!("b contains: {}", *b);
}
```

In this example, `10` is stored on the heap, and `b` is a `Box` pointing to it. When `b` goes out of scope, the memory for `10` on the heap is automatically deallocated.
