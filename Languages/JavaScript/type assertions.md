They provide a way to tell TypeScript the type of a variable.

```ts
const displayName = e?.spec?.profile as { displayName: string };
```

Here, `(e?.spec?.profile as { displayName: string })` tells TypeScript to treat `e?.spec?.profile` as an object with a `displayName` property of type `string`. However, be careful! If `e?.spec?.profile` is not actually of this shape at runtime, it could lead to errors.

Use this pattern when you're confident about the shape of the data, but TypeScript can't infer it directly. However, ensure accuracy in your type assertions to prevent potential runtime errors.
