```ts
import('./foo').then(m => m.default)
```

This is used for dynamic imports in JavaScript, specifically within the context of modules and promises. Let's break down what it does and why it's structured this way:
### Dynamic Imports
- **Purpose**: Dynamic imports load modules on demand (lazily), rather than at the start of the file execution. This can improve performance by only loading resources when they are needed.
- **Syntax**: `import(modulePath)` returns a promise that resolves to the module. This is different from static imports, which are declared at the top of files and load modules synchronously.

### The `.then(m => m.default)` Part
- **Module Object**: When the dynamic import's promise resolves, it returns a module object (`m` in this case). This object contains all the exports from the module you imported.
- **Accessing the Default Export**: Many modules export functions, classes, or values using the `export default` syntax. To access this default export, you use `m.default`.
- **Why Use `.then()`**: The `.then()` method is used to handle the promise returned by `import()`. It waits for the promise to resolve and then executes a callback function. In this case, the callback function accesses the `default` property of the module object, which is the module's default export.

### Practical Example
Suppose you have a module `foo.js` that looks like this:
```javascript
// foo.js
export default function greet() {
  console.log("Hello from foo!");
}
```

When you want to dynamically import this module and use the `greet` function, you do:
```javascript
import('./foo').then(m => m.default());
```

Here's what happens:
1. `import('./foo')` dynamically loads the `foo.js` module, returning a promise.
2. `.then(m => m.default())` waits for that promise to resolve, giving you the module object `m`. It then accesses `m.default`, which is the `greet` function, and calls it.

### Why Dynamic Import Like This?
- **Flexibility and Performance**: Dynamically importing modules allows your application to load faster by only loading the parts that are needed for the current operation. It's particularly useful for large applications, code splitting, or when certain modules are only needed under specific conditions.
- **Code Splitting**: This pattern is often used in web development to achieve code splitting, where your code is divided into chunks that are loaded only when needed. This can significantly reduce the initial loading time of your web application.
