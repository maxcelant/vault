`Object.fromEntries()` is a powerful method in JavaScript that transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object. It serves as the inverse of `Object.entries()`, which converts an object into an array of key-value pairs.

### Syntax
```javascript
Object.fromEntries(iterable);
```

- `iterable`: An iterable such as Array or Map that yields key-value pairs (arrays with two elements, e.g., `[[key1, val1], [key2, val2]]`).

### Use Cases
- Converting Map objects to plain objects.
- Transforming arrays of entries back into object form after using array methods like `.map()` or `.filter()` on `Object.entries()`.

### Example Usage
```javascript
const entries = new Map([
  ['name', 'Alice'],
  ['age', 25]
]);

const obj = Object.fromEntries(entries);
console.log(obj); // { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }
```

### Practical Application
In web development, `Object.fromEntries()` can be particularly useful when working with data that needs to be transformed or manipulated before being sent to an API, especially when the data's structure needs to be converted from an array to an object format.

### Benefits
- Simplifies the transformation of array data into object data.
- Facilitates easy conversion of Maps to Objects, which is often required for JSON serialization.
