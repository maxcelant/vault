- By default flex children only take as much space as they require.
- If we add `flex: 1` to a child, it will take up as much room as it can within the flexbox, leaving just enough for other elements within.
	- If you have multiple items with `flex: 1` they will distribute the space equally.
	- If you have  foo with `flex: 2` and  bar with `flex: 3` on the other, then bar will take up 3/5ths of the available space.
