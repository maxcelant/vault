1. **Component Structure:**
   - **Functional Components**: Prefer functional components over class components for simplicity and better performance with React hooks.
   - **Hooks**: Use React hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`) for state management and lifecycle events in functional components.
   - **PropTypes**: Define `PropTypes` for components to ensure proper usage of props and enhance readability.

2. **File Organization:**
   - **Component Organization**: Organize your components in a clear structure, often separating screens, shared components, and utilities.
   - **Naming Conventions**: Use PascalCase for component names and camelCase for functions and variables.
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Keep your business logic separate from UI components where possible.

3. **Styling:**
   - **StyleSheet Usage**: Use `StyleSheet.create` to define styles, which is more efficient than inline styling.
   - **Consistent Styling**: Maintain a consistent styling approach throughout your application, whether you choose inline styles, separate stylesheets, or a combination of both.

4. **State Management:**
   - **Local vs. Global State**: Use local state for component-specific data and consider state management libraries (like Redux, MobX, or Context API) for global state.
   - **Immutable State Updates**: Always treat state as immutable, updating it in an immutable manner (especially important in global state management).

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - **Avoiding Unnecessary Renders**: Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
   - **Loading and Caching Images**: Optimize image loading and caching for better performance.

6. **Navigation:**
   - **Use Popular Navigation Libraries**: Utilize libraries like React Navigation for handling in-app navigation effectively.

7. **Code Quality:**
   - **Linting and Formatting**: Use tools like ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and to catch common errors.
   - **Comments and Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary and maintain good documentation, especially for custom utilities and complex components.

8. **Testing:**
   - **Write Tests**: Write unit and integration tests for your components using libraries like Jest and testing-library/react-native.

9. **Accessibility:**
   - **Accessibility Features**: Make use of accessibility features provided by React Native to make your app usable by as many people as possible.

10. **Learning and Community Engagement:**
    - **Follow React Native Updates**: Keep up to date with the latest React Native releases and changes.
    - **Engage with the Community**: Participate in forums, read blogs, and contribute to open-source projects to stay informed and get support.
