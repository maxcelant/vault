#### Workflow Files
Defined in `.github/workflows`

Check out the **[[Anatomy of a Workflow]]** to see how a workflow is structured.

Workflows should contain the following:
- **[[Naming]]** - To make your workflow have a specific identifier.
- **[['On' Keyword]]** - To decide the trigger for the workflow event.
- **[[CICD/Github Workflows/Jobs]]** - To perform a specific requirement.
- **[['Uses' Keyword]]** - That points to an existing action.
- **[['Run' Keyword]]** - That is used to execute a command directly.
