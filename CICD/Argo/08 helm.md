It's a package manager for Kubernetes. Similar to npm for Node.js or yum for CentOS, but specifically designed for Kubernetes.

It helps you manage Kubernetes applications. It uses a packaging format called `charts`. A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.

You might have a single chart that deploys a simple pod or a complex full web app with databases, servers, etc.

```bash
/mychart/
  Chart.yaml
  values.yaml
  charts/
  templates/
```

- `Chart.yaml`: A YAML file containing information about the chart
- `values.yaml`: The default configuration values for this chart
- `charts/`: A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends
- `templates/`: A directory of templates that, when combined with values, generate valid Kubernetes manifest files

#### Helm's Templating System

1. **Helm's Templating System**: You know how in school, you might have filled in the blanks on a worksheet? Helm's templates are similar. They're like worksheets with blanks for certain pieces of information, such as the name of your app or the number of replicas you want to deploy.
    
2. **`templates/` Directory**: This is where all your worksheets (template files) live. These templates describe what resources (like Pods, Services, Deployments) you want to create in your Kubernetes cluster.
    
3. **`values.yaml` File**: This is where you write down the answers (values) for the blanks in your worksheets. For example, you might specify that the name of your app is "my-app" and that you want 3 replicas.
    
4. **Deploying a Helm Chart**: When you're ready to deploy your app, you give Helm your worksheets (templates) and your answers (values). Helm then fills in the blanks on the worksheets with your answers to produce complete, filled-out Kubernetes manifests. These manifests are then applied to your Kubernetes cluster to create or update your app.
    
5. **Your Own `values.yaml` File**: Sometimes, you might want to use different answers for different situations. For example, in a development environment, you might want only 1 replica, but in a production environment, you might want 5. You can create different `values.yaml` files for these different situations, and give Helm the appropriate one when you deploy your app.
