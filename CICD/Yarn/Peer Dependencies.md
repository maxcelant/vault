`peerDependencies` in a `package.json` file are used by a library or plugin to specify which versions of a dependency it is compatible with, but it does not install those dependencies. This is particularly useful when a library is intended to be used alongside other packages that it integrates with, such as plugins for frameworks or tools. By declaring a dependency as a `peerDependency`, the library is saying, "I need this package to be present, but I'm expecting you (the consumer of my library) to provide it, ensuring we're all using the same version." This avoids version conflicts and reduces duplication in the node_modules directory. It's up to the consumer's project to include these peer dependencies in its own `package.json` file.

#### Example:
```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^16.0.0"
  }
}
```
This means the library needs `react` version 16.0.0 or later, but it won't install `react` itself; it expects the consuming project to have `react` installed.

**Usage Context**: When developing a library or plugin meant to work with specific versions of a host package or framework to ensure compatibility and avoid multiple versions of the same package.
