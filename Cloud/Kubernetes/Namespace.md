A way to divide cluster resources among multiple users. 

Think of a Kubernetes cluster as a large house with many rooms. Without any organization, it could get chaotic pretty quickly with everyone doing their own thing in the same space. So, to keep things orderly, we divide this house into rooms (namespaces), and each person (or team, or project) gets their own room to work in.

Names between a namespace need to be unique. So you could have a 'pod' named 'myapp' in the 'development' namespace, and another 'pod' named 'myapp' in the 'testing' namespace, and they'd be two completely different pods.

You'd normally have a different namespace for each environment (like dev, testing, and prod). You can allocate different amounts of resources to each namespace.

Some resources, like nodes and persistent volumes, are cluster-wide and not tied to any specific namespace.

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get pods -n kube-system    // Will show all pods in this namespace
```
