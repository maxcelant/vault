1. User sends a request to post a new message from the client-side application (web browser or mobile app).
    
2. The request first hits an external load balancer (like Google Cloud Load Balancer) that's outside the Kubernetes cluster. The Load Balancer exposes your service (front-end service in this case) to the outside world and knows to which node it should forward the request.
    
3. The request then hits a NodePort on the appropriate Node.
    
    **Kubernetes Control Plane Involvement**:
    
    The `kube-apiserver` component on the Master Node is responsible for exposing the service via a NodePort. It does this based on the rules defined in the Kubernetes Service configuration.
    
4. The NodePort forwards the request to the right Kubernetes Service (the front-end service) within the cluster.
    
5. The front-end service forwards the request to one of its Pods.
    
    **Kubernetes Control Plane Involvement**:
    
    The `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager` have been involved in creating and scheduling these Pods in the worker nodes. They continually monitor the health and status of the pods and take necessary actions whenever the actual state deviates from the desired state (like creating a new pod if one fails).
    
6. The Pod processes the request. If needed, it communicates with other services within the cluster to get or set any necessary data. In this case, it needs to send a request to the back-end service to store the new post in the database.
    
7. The back-end service then processes this request, forwarding it to the appropriate Pod to store the new post in the database.
    
    **Kubernetes Control Plane Involvement**:
    
    Similar to the front-end pods, the `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager` have been involved in creating and scheduling these back-end pods as well.
    
8. This Pod then confirms to the back-end service that the operation was successful.
    
9. The back-end service relays this success status back to the front-end service.
    
10. The front-end service then relays this success status back up the chain, eventually reaching the user who sees a confirmation that their post was successfully created.
    

Throughout this process, the `etcd` component on the Master Node serves as the consistent and highly-available store for all Kubernetes cluster data. It stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the state of the cluster at any given point of time. The other components of the Control Plane communicate with `etcd` to fetch information about services, pods, etc. or to change their state or configuration.

Also, the `kube-apiserver` is continuously involved as it's the front-end of the Kubernetes control plane and exposes the Kubernetes API, through which all interactions with the cluster are carried out.

Finally, the `kubelet` on each worker node is responsible for ensuring that the pods are running as expected. It communicates with the control plane components to receive instructions and to report on pod status.

If any node fails or becomes unreachable, the `kube-controller-manager` notices this and will reschedule the pods on a different node, to ensure the desired state of the system is maintained.
